    <h2>Research on TBI and Music Therapy</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>My thesis for college was on traumatic brain injury and how music therapy can positively impact physical and mental therapy for patients experiencing a traumatic brain injury.</p>
    <p>Essentially, I found that music therpy is in fact helpful in the healing process, but it should not replace any other therapy, only included in the standard care.</p>

    <h2>Research on Eduction and Vaccines</h2>
    <p>In high school I conducted a research project on the efficacy of education on vaccination rates within the homeless population.</p>
    <p> In this research I found that those who were given education were more likely to get ther flu vaccine because they were able to understand what was fact and what was a myth.</p>

    <h2>Further Research Endeavors</h2>
    <p>If I had the opportunity to do more cognitive science research in the future, I would like to continue my work in understanding brain injury, rehabilitation, and how music therapy plays a part in that.</p>
    <p>While I have alread done some research in this field, my topic was more broad than I would have liked, so I would like to be able to contribute to those works, but in order to do so I would have to get a PHd.</p>
